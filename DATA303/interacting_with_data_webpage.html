  <h2>Voting Behavior vs Education vs Income</h2>

    &emsp;This is a parallel coordinates plot, which shows us voting behavior across the US, and demonstrates the correlation between 
    voting behavior, education, and income. We can see how people who tend to vote always, or rarely/never tend to fall into certain 
    education and income groups a little more or less.
    
    <br><br>
    &emsp;There doesn't appear to be a strong relationship between voting frequency and either income or education. 
    This is supported by the fact that the distribution of voting behaviors is nearly the same, for all subgroups 
    of education and income. In every case but two, the largest group of people are sporadic voters, fewer always vote, 
    and the least rarely/never vote. Only when education is "high school or less" or income is "< $40k" do we see that 
    there are more people who rarely/never vote than who always vote.
    <br><br>
    &emsp;Although it is harder to tell with this particular parallel coordinates plot, education and income do appear to be correlated.
    Those with the least education (high school or less) tend to end up in the lowest income category most of the time. Those with 
    "some college" fall into all income categories fairly evenly, and those with "college" mostly tend to have an income over $125k, 
    and if not that, then typically $75-$125k.

    &emsp;This is a bubble plot with one bubble for each county in Virginia. The size represents the total number of active voters within the county,
    the color represents the region of the state the county is in, and the X and Y axes measure the county's percentage of voter turnout 
    (out of all active voters) versus the percentage of absentee voters (out of turnout).
    <br><br>
    &emsp;2020 is clearly different from the others, as it has the highest percentage of Absentee voters due to the effects of COVID-19. 
    It wouldn't have been easier to tell using multiple plots, because the animation frame is all within the same space: it is better
    at helping us see changes that occur over the X and Y axes at the same time. 
    <br><br>
    &emsp;2018 is also very different, because it has extraordinary voter turnout rates. Nearly a dozen counties mostly in Hampton Roads and 
    Central Virginia saw over 100% voter turnout. This is due to how we measured it (total turnout / active registered voters). It must 
    be due to an abnormally large amount of typically inactive voters choosing to vote that year, probably related to the frenzy surrounding 
    Trump's presidency.
    <br><br>
    &emsp;There is also a noticeably higher voter turnout for presidential elections as opposed to midterm elections. With the exception of 2018, midterm 
    elections tend to see a turnout of roughly 40-60% across all counties, but presidential elections see roughly 65-85% voter turnout

    &emsp;This is a cloropleth map which shows us the overall voter turnout for 2022 in Virginia, at the county-level. We can see the percentage 
    of active voters in each county who came and voted that year.
    <br><br>
    &emsp;We can see that turnout is higher in the more urban, more populous 
    counties of Northern and Eastern Virginia. The Appalachian counties see lower voter turnouts. We also can see that 
    the counties that experienced the highest voter turnouts are Highland, Madison, Goochland, and Powhatan county, with 
    Rappahannock having the highest turnout of 67.40%.
