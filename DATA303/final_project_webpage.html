  Notes regarding the original dataset:
  <br> &emsp;&emsp;&bull; "Total Crimes" does not include traffic arrests.
  <br> &emsp;&emsp;&bull; "Total Violent Crimes" are offenses of murder and nonnegligent manslaughter, rape, robbery, and aggravated assault. "Property Crimes" are offenses of burglary, larceny-theft, motor vehicle theft, and arson.
  <br> &emsp;&emsp;&bull; The rape figures in this table are aggregate totals of the data submitted based on both the legacy and revised Uniform Crime Reporting definitions.
  <br> &emsp;&emsp;&bull; Drunkenness is not considered a crime in some states; therefore, the figures vary widely from state to state.
  <br> &emsp;&emsp;&bull; Limited data for 2019 was available for Alabama.
  <br> &emsp;&emsp;&bull; For DC, includes arrests reported by the DC Fire and Emergency Medical Services: Arson Investigation Unit and the Metro Transit Police. These agencies have no population associated with them.
  <br> &emsp;&emsp;&bull; The Florida arrest counts for offenses against the family and children, drunkenness, disorderly conduct, vagrancy, suspicion, and curfew and loitering law violations are included under the category "All other offenses" (except for the data submitted by two Bureau of Indian Affairs agencies that provided data using those specific breakdowns).

  <br>
  <p style="margin: 0 20% 0 20%; text-align:left;">
    There are a lot of strange patterns to be found here:
    <br><br>
    &emsp;&emsp;&bull;For the vast majority of all types of crime, Illinois takes the cake. This makes sense, because of Chicago, 
    <a href="https://www.mystateline.com/news/chicago-named-murder-capital-of-the-u-s-in-new-report/">the well-known crime capital of the US.</a> 
    The state is also known for having some pretty tough regulations.
    <br><br>
    &emsp;&emsp;&bull;Strangely, 
    <a href="https://studybreaks.com/thoughts/why-is-the-crime-rate-so-high-in-alaska/">Alaska often has very high rates of crime</a>
    for a lot of different crimes in this list. 
    <br><br>
    &emsp;&emsp;&bull;Burglaries are most common in Louisiana. This is probably related to all of the hurricanes which, after devestating the state, 
    leave it open for easy pickings by criminals. This has been explored before, in
    <a href="https://aquila.usm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1710&context=honors_theses">this paper</a>.
    <br><br>
    &emsp;&emsp;&bull;Fraud is highest in Delaware. This makes sense since 
    <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/06/panama-papers-us-tax-havens-delaware">Delaware's tax laws are particularly loose</a>, 
    for big businesses take advantage of. It would make sense that a lot of these fraud cases are related to Delaware's popularity as a tax haven.
    <br><br>
    &emsp;&emsp;&bull;Possession of stolen goods is most common in Missouri. Cities in Missouri have been reported to be
    <a href="https://fox4kc.com/news/these-are-the-top-20-car-theft-capitals-of-the-u-s/">the car-theft capitals of the US</a>. It's possible these are related,
    although those may fall under vehicle theft instead.
    <br><br>
    &emsp;&emsp;&bull;Very predictably, the crime of prostitution is decidedly common in Nevada. Other sex-related crimes are most common in Nevada, in addition to vagrancy.
    <br><br>
    &emsp;&emsp;&bull;Gambling crimes are quite strange, occuring rarely, but at the highest rate among Hawaiians. One might expect Nevada, but no, it's Hawaii.
    The reason for this is that 
    <a href="https://www.findlaw.com/state/hawaii-law/hawaii-gambling-laws.html">Hawaii has very strict laws prohibiting gambling in the state</a>.
    Any forms of Gambling are heavily clamped down upon by the state.
    <br><br>
    &emsp;&emsp;&bull;Wyoming, the least populous state, strikes the highest for all drug- and alcohol-related crimes. Most drug convictions
    <a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/docs/state_profile_-_wyoming_0.pdf">are related to marijuana</a>,
    which is
    <a href="https://disa.com/maps/marijuana-legality-by-state">entirely prohibited</a>
    in the state of Wyoming.
    <br><br>
    &emsp;&emsp;&bull;It is hard to say why, but Wisconsin has the highest rate of disorderly conduct, in addition to Illinois. This one is very interesting, 
    and there don't seem to be any substantial investigations into this. Their legal definition for disorderly conduct can be found 
    <a href="https://law.justia.com/codes/wyoming/2019/title-6/chapter-6/article-1/section-6-6-102/"> here</a>,
    but it doesn't seem particularly vauge, or unusual. 
    <br><br>
    &emsp;&emsp;&bull;A curious one is "All other offenses (except traffic offenses)", where Kentucky shows the highest rate of this aggregate category. The original dataset doesn't
    provide us any real way to determine what exactly these crimes were, so, it's very difficult to say what these thousands of "other" crimes are.
    <br><br><br><br>
    ... and there are plenty more interesting patterns here, many of which are difficult to explain. A lot of them likely arise from technicalities in the legal codes of the 
    different states, or from anomalies particular to 2019 when the data was gathered, and all of them would require far more research to determine the true source of the crime rates.

  <!-- This loads our second map, which shows us the most common crime in each state -->
  <h2 >The Most Commonly Committed Crimes</h2>
  <p style="margin: 0 20% 0 20%; text-align:left;">
  This map is a little different. Here we are shown, for each state, the crime which people are most often convicted of in that state. 
  <br> This doesn't include any totals of crimes, or vaguely defined crimes like "other non-traffic offences" and "other assaults".
  </p>
  <p style="margin: 0 20% 0 20%;"></p>
  <iframe src="final_project_webpage_files/most_common_crime.html" width="100%" height="700em" frameborder="0" ></iframe>
  <br><br>
  <p style="margin: 0 20% 0 20%; text-align:left;">
  We can see that, for the majority of states, the most commonly commited crimes are drug-related offences. Several most often have DUI convictions or larceny and theft.
  Only in Wisconsin, Illinois, and Connecticut do we see that the most commonly commited crime is, of all things, disorderly conduct. DC uniquely has mostly crimes which
  fall under "liquor laws".
