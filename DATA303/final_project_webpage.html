  <h1>Crime in the United States</h1>
  <p> 
    <i> These metrics are per-capita, that is, the crimes in each state is divided by the population of that state. 
      <br> Puerto Rico is not in the FBI crime dataset, therefore, it is always NaN for all of these maps.
      <br> All of the data here was taken from the FBI's <a href="https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2019/crime-in-the-u.s.-2019/tables/table-69">Crime in the United States 2019</a> 
    </i>

  <h2>Total Crime</h2>
  <iframe src="./final_project_webpage_files/total_crime_map.html" width="100%" height="500" frameborder="0"></iframe>
  <p style="text-align:left;"> 
    Total crime appears to be strongest in South Dakota, Kentucky, and Mississippi, peaking in Illinois with 56.602 crimes per 1000 persons.
    <br><br><br>
  </p>

  <h2>Burglaries</h2>
  <iframe src="./final_project_webpage_files/burglary_map.html" width="100%" height="500" frameborder="0"></iframe>
  <p style="text-align:left;"> 
    Burglaries... in Louisiana and Nevada? Louisiana makes some sense, I have heard of tons of property being 
    stolen after hurricanes hit Louisiana. <br> It is highest in Louisiana with 1.089 burglaries per 1000 persons.
    <br> California also makes sense, there are a lot of problems over there.
    <br> But Nevada, I don't know. And Alaska I'm also left clueless. Alaska? Really? 
    <br><br><br>
  </p>

  <h2>Fraud</h2>
  <iframe src="./final_project_webpage_files/fraud_map.html" width="100%" height="500" frameborder="0"></iframe>
  <p style="text-align:left;"> 
    Most frauds are caught in... Delaware, with 1.352 frauds caught for every 1000 persons in Delaware.
    <br> This makes sense since Delaware has some special tax loopholes that a lot of businesses take advantage of, so I would
    <br> guess that a lot of the frauds are related to those businesses.
    <br><br><br>
  </p>

  <h2>Gambling</h2>
  <iframe src="./final_project_webpage_files/gambling_map.html" width="100%" height="500" frameborder="0"></iframe>
  <p style="text-align:left;"> 
    What's this? It appears that most gambling crimes occur in... Hawaii? I have no answer for this. 
    <br> Even so, it's useful to note that this number is still extremely small: only 9 frauds every <i>100,000</i> persons.
